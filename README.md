<-- Implementing Golang JWToken for correct authorization management --><br>

Microservice aimed to create authorization in [.NETCoreChallenge](https://github.com/SebastianRaiquenParisi/.NETCoreChallenge), although it could be used on any project that I make from now on!<br>
Working as if I had a team that is currently working on the .NET side, focusing on implementing the Microservice first and then working on the .NET Project.


Here I'll create the users json (later it will be a non relational database) from a [JSON file](https://reqres.in/api/users) but creating the passwords internally


Obviously the private key should not be inside the github repository and should be alocated in some other folder locally, but since it is not a real project... it seemed appropriate to show every bit of it in this repository
