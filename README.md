Microservice aimed to create authorization in [.NETCoreChallenge](https://github.com/SebastianRaiquenParisi/.NETCoreChallenge), although it could be used on any project that I make from now on!<br>
Working as if I had a team that is currently working on the .NET side, focusing on implementing the Microservice first and then working on the .NET Project.
